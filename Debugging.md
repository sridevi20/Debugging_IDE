1).What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
    Breakpoint  helps in debugging of code. We can set the breakpoint to specify where execution should pause when we are running an application
    in IDE

2). Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

    It will run normally until it hits that line .Once it reaches that line it will stop the execution and pause the application and log debug console.

3). How do we debug the next line of code?
    We use Step over,to jump to the next line of code and pause before it runs. For instance,if we are at line 9 and execute the step over action then it will move execution to line 10.

4). What does the step into command do?
    If the line  contain a function the debugger will enter inside the function
    and continue line-by-line debugging there .

5). What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code
      fragment?
    Evaluate Expression Mode is used Â for evaluating single-line expressions. It means it will evaluate or runs single line java code,call methods. Where  Code fragment mode evaluates or runs multiple lines of code and also creates temporary variables to store values.
